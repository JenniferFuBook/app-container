    <p>
      What is a micro front-ends approach? The term micro front-ends first came
      up in the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar in November 2016. It extends the
      concepts of microservices to front-end development.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach is to split the browser-based code into micro front-ends by
      breaking down application features. By making smaller and feature-centered
      codebases, we achieve the software development goal of decoupling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the codebases are decoupled, the user experiences are coherent.
      In addition, each codebase can be implemented, upgraded, updated, and
      deployed independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the paradise of micro front-ends. JavaScript applications,
      regardless of frameworks and versions, are launched by a container. These
      applications, legacy and new, work together seamlessly, and act like one
      application.

        I am an App Container. <br/>
        In the links below, Home is a component bundled with the App Container.
